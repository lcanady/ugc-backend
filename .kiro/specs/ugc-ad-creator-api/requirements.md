# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Node.js RESTful API server for generating UGC (User Generated Content) ads. The system accepts a creative brief and multiple images, analyzes the content, generates or refines video scripts based on the brief, and produces final video content. Users can provide their own script suggestions or let the AI generate scripts automatically based on the creative brief and image analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload multiple images with a creative brief, so that I can provide comprehensive input for UGC ad generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads images via POST request THEN the system SHALL accept up to a configurable maximum number of images
2. WHEN images are received THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
3. WHEN a creative brief is provided THEN the system SHALL accept it as text input alongside the images
4. IF the number of images exceeds the limit THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
5. IF no creative brief is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error requesting the brief
6. WHEN an optional script is provided THEN the system SHALL accept it as additional input for refinement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to analyze uploaded images and creative brief, so that it can understand the context for UGC generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL analyze each image using AI vision to understand content
2. WHEN analyzing images THEN the system SHALL identify objects, people, settings, and actions visible in each image
3. WHEN a creative brief is provided THEN the system SHALL parse it to understand the campaign goals and requirements
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL combine image analysis with creative brief context
5. IF image analysis fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate or refine video scripts based on creative brief and image analysis, so that I can create structured content for video generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no script is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a complete 2-segment video script using OpenAI
2. WHEN an optional script is provided THEN the system SHALL use it as-is or refine it based on image analysis and creative brief
3. WHEN generating or refining scripts THEN the system SHALL ensure each segment is 7-8 seconds of realistic action
4. WHEN creating scripts THEN the system SHALL only reference objects and elements visible in the uploaded images
5. WHEN the script is ready THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with segment-1 and segment-2 fields
6. IF script generation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate videos from images and scripts, so that I can create complete UGC ad content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a script and image are provided THEN the system SHALL send requests to Kie AI VEO3 API
2. WHEN generating videos THEN the system SHALL create separate videos for each script segment
3. WHEN videos are processing THEN the system SHALL poll the status until completion
4. WHEN both videos are ready THEN the system SHALL merge them into a single video file
5. IF video generation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RESTful endpoints for the UGC generation workflow, so that I can integrate the functionality into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL expose endpoints for script generation and video creation
2. WHEN requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters, file formats, and creative brief content
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with meaningful messages
5. WHEN successful THEN the system SHALL return data in consistent JSON format
6. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL support multipart/form-data for multiple images

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details
2. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate timeout responses
3. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return clear error messages
4. WHEN the system processes requests THEN the system SHALL log request/response information for monitoring

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration management for API keys and endpoints, so that I can deploy the system in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN API keys are needed THEN the system SHALL securely access them from configuration
3. WHEN external service URLs change THEN the system SHALL use configurable endpoint URLs
4. IF required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
